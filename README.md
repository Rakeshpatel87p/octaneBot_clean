Background

I love coffee but hate lines. Each day, the line would keep me away from a hot cup and favorite seat at a coffee shop. Paying attention more to chatbots and their potential, I thought to aim this new technology on reducing wait times.

Solution

Octane-Bot was born. This chatbot would focus on the most popular drinks of to-go drinkers as a starting point. Users, upon opening the bot, will be presented with a menu of three options. After making their selection, they can "checkout", sending the order to the coffee shop.

Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: http://rakeshrpatel.com/octane-Bot/index.html

Technical

I used NodeJS and Express to interact with Facebook Messenger.


Development Roadmap
This is v1.0 of the app, validating that there is some interest in this idea.

Facebook chatbots recently started taking payments! This will be the key feature of v2. I also want to order multiple quantity options for those ordering more than 1 drink.
